# AGP (Agentic Programming Project) Instructions

## System Purpose

AGP creates a standardized knowledge layer that enables any AI assistant to understand and work with a project without prior context. The `.agp` directory serves as persistent memory that accumulates project knowledge over time.

## Core Principle

**Any AI should be able to pick up any task in this project by reading the `.agp` directory.**

```

## AI Workflows

### Step 0: Initialize Session Context (ALWAYS FIRST)

**MANDATORY**: Before any task, execute this sequence:

1. **Check for config file**:
    - IF `.agp/.config.json` exists → read `session.user` and `session.current`
    - IF NOT exists → create with empty session info (user will be set via `agp start`)

2. **Load project requirements**:
    - IF `.agp/requirements.md` exists → read and follow all user preferences and rules
    - IF NOT exists → create minimal template for future use

3. **Load current session**:
    - IF `session.current` path exists → read session file for context
    - IF NOT exists → create new session file for current user

4. **Validate session directory**:
    - IF `.agp/sessions/{user}/` does not exist → create directory and `index.md`

### Workflow 1: Modifying Existing Files

**When**: Task involves changing existing source files

**Steps**:
1. **Load session context**: Read `.agp/sessions/{user}/index.md`
2. **Check file conflicts**:
    - Scan ALL `.agp/sessions/*/index.md` files
    - IF target file appears in another user's "Active Files" → STOP and report conflict
3. **Find knowledge**: Read `.agp/project/{file-path}.md`
    - IF knowledge file does not exist → create minimal version first
4. **Follow dependencies**: Read all files mentioned in Dependencies and Related sections
5. **Modify source code**: Make the requested changes
6. **Update knowledge**: Modify `.agp/project/{file-path}.md` with new information
7. **Update session**: Add file to "Active Files" and record progress in session

### Workflow 2: Adding New Features

**When**: Task involves creating new functionality or files

**Steps**:
1. **Load session context**: Read `.agp/sessions/{user}/index.md`
2. **Study architecture**: Read `.agp/architecture/overview.md` and `.agp/patterns/overview.md`
3. **Find similar patterns**: Search `.agp/architecture/feature-domains.md` for related features
4. **Check implementation patterns**: Look for applicable patterns in `.agp/patterns/`
5. **Create source files**: Build new files following established patterns
6. **Create knowledge files**: For each new source file, create `.agp/project/{file-path}.md`
7. **Update overviews**: Add new features to `.agp/architecture/feature-domains.md`
8. **Link knowledge**: Ensure all new knowledge connects to existing files
9. **Update session**: Record all new files and progress

### Workflow 3: Session Continuation

**When**: Resuming previous work or starting new session

**Steps**:
1. **Read config**: Check `.agp/.config.json` for current user and session path
2. **Load session**: Read user's `.agp/sessions/{user}/index.md`
3. **Check file status**: Verify all "Active Files" are still available for editing
4. **Resume tasks**: Continue from "In Progress" items
5. **Update session**: Keep session file current with progress

## Session Management

### Configuration Schema

The `.agp/.config.json` file stores local session information (NOT committed to Git):

```json
{
  "session": {
    "user": "alice", 
    "current": ".agp/sessions/alice/index.md"
  }
}
```

**Schema Purpose:**
- `session.user`: Current active user name
- `session.current`: Full path to current session file

### Session File Structure

Each user maintains their own session directory:

```
.agp/sessions/alice/
├── index.md                    # Current active work
├── 2025-01-12-auth-refactor.md # Completed session 1
└── 2025-01-10-api-redesign.md  # Completed session 2
```

### Session File Format

**MANDATORY Structure for `.agp/sessions/{user}/index.md`:**

```markdown
# {Username} - Current Session

## Active Files
- {file-path} (editing since {HH:MM}) - {brief-description}
- {file-path} (reviewing) - {brief-description}

## In Progress
- [ ] {task-description} (priority: {high|medium|low})
- [ ] {task-description} (files: {file1, file2})
- [x] {completed-task-description}

## Blocked
- [ ] {blocked-task} (waiting for: {reason})
- [ ] {blocked-task} (depends on: {other-user-or-task})

## Next Up
- [ ] {planned-task} (after: {prerequisite})
- [ ] {planned-task} (estimated: {duration})

## Decisions Made
- {YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM}: {decision-description} (context: {why})
- {YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM}: {technical-choice} (alternatives: {options})

## Notes & Context
- {important-context-or-insight}
- {temporary-workaround-or-limitation}
- {performance-considerations}
- {breaking-changes-or-migrations}
```

### Session Compacting Rules

**When AI should compact `index.md`:**
- When session has more than 10 completed tasks in "In Progress" section
- When user explicitly requests to end work session
- When starting completely different feature area (detected by context change)

**How AI should compact:**
1. Move current `index.md` → `{YYYY-MM-DD}-{brief-summary}.md`
2. Create new empty `index.md` with username header only
3. Update `.config.json` to point to new `index.md`
4. Record compacting action in new session file

**Compacting triggers during workflow:**
- **Check during Step 0**: If current session has 10+ completed tasks → compact before proceeding
- **Check after task completion**: If task marks 10th completion → compact immediately
- **Check on feature change**: If new task is unrelated to current session context → compact first

## Knowledge File Format

### Standard Structure

**MANDATORY**: Every source file MUST have corresponding `.agp/project/{file-path}.md`:

```markdown
# {FileName}

## Purpose
- What this file does and why it exists

## Dependencies  
- **Input**: Files this depends on → .agp/project/{path}.md
- **Output**: Files that depend on this → .agp/project/{path}.md
- **External**: Third-party libraries and versions

## Context
- How this fits into the larger system
- When/where this gets used

## Gotchas
- Common problems and edge cases
- Performance considerations
- Breaking change risks

## Related
- **Patterns**: .agp/patterns/{pattern}.md
- **Architecture**: .agp/architecture/{topic}.md
- **Similar**: .agp/project/{similar-file}.md
```

## Mandatory Execution Rules

### BEFORE Every Task
1. **ALWAYS execute Step 0** (Initialize Session Context)
2. **Check for conflicts** by scanning other users' active files
3. **Read relevant knowledge** files before making changes
4. **Validate file paths** exist before attempting to read

### AFTER Every Task
1. **Update knowledge files** immediately after code changes
2. **Update session file** with current progress and active files
3. **Link new knowledge** to existing files in Related sections
4. **Create missing knowledge files** for any new source files

### File Handling Rules
- **IF file does not exist** → create it with minimal required structure
- **IF knowledge file missing** → generate it from source code analysis
- **IF conflict detected** → report to user and request resolution
- **IF session directory missing** → create full directory structure

### Knowledge Discovery Commands

Use these patterns to find knowledge:

```bash
# Specific file knowledge
.agp/project/src/components/Auth.tsx.md

# Explore directory
.agp/project/src/components/*.md

# Find all project knowledge  
.agp/project/**/*.md

# Check all user sessions
.agp/sessions/*/index.md

# Find architecture docs
.agp/architecture/*.md
```

## CLI Commands

### `agp init`
- **Purpose**: Initialize new AGP project
- **Actions**:
    - Downloads AGP template from remote repository
    - Analyzes project structure and generates initial knowledge files
    - Sets up Git submodule for `.agp` directory
    - Prompts for remote repository URL for submodule
    - Creates initial `.gitignore` entry for `.config.json`

### `agp start`
- **Purpose**: Start or resume user session
- **Actions**:
    - Prompts for user name if not configured
    - Creates/updates `.agp/.config.json` with session info
    - Creates user session directory if new user
    - Loads existing session context for returning users

### `agp push`
- **Purpose**: Push AGP knowledge and session progress to remote repository
- **Actions**:
    - Commits all AGP changes with smart commit messages
    - Pushes to remote AGP repository
    - Updates parent repository submodule reference
    - Enables team collaboration and knowledge sharing

## Success Criteria

The system works when:
- Any AI can work on any file without additional context
- File conflicts are prevented through session tracking
- Knowledge grows richer and more connected over time
- Session continuity enables seamless work resumption
- All source files have corresponding knowledge documentation

## Project Requirements Management

### Requirements File (`.agp/requirements.md`)

**Purpose**: Store project-specific user preferences, coding standards, and behavioral rules that AI should follow consistently.

**When to Update**:
- User expresses specific preferences during work sessions
- User provides explicit rules or constraints
- User corrects AI behavior with specific instructions
- Team establishes new coding standards or conventions

**Examples of Requirements**:
- Commit message formats and restrictions
- Code style preferences
- Documentation standards
- Tool usage preferences
- Language or framework-specific rules

**MANDATORY**: AI must read and follow ALL requirements in this file before any task execution.

### Requirements Update Process

**When AI Should Update Requirements**:
1. **User provides explicit behavioral rules** (e.g., "always use logger instead of console.log")
2. **User corrects repeated mistakes** that indicate a missing requirement
3. **User establishes new coding standards** for the project
4. **User expresses preferences** that should apply to all future work

**How to Update Requirements**:
1. **Read current requirements.md** to understand existing structure
2. **Add new requirements** to appropriate sections:
    - Code Standards (for coding rules)
    - Git and Commit Standards (for version control rules)
    - Tool Usage (for development tool preferences)
    - Communication (for response style preferences)
3. **Update version number** and last updated date at bottom
4. **Be specific and actionable** - write rules that future AI can follow exactly
5. **Use consistent formatting** with existing requirements

**Requirements Update Examples**:
- User says "use logger not console.log" → Add to Code Standards
- User corrects commit message format → Add to Git Standards
- User prefers specific response style → Add to Communication
- User establishes testing requirements → Add to Tool Usage

**CRITICAL**: Always update requirements.md when user establishes new rules to ensure consistent behavior across all AI interactions.

## Critical Notes

- The `.agp` directory is a Git submodule (separate from main codebase)
- `.config.json` is local-only (added to .gitignore) and stores current user/session
- `requirements.md` is committed to Git and shared across all users and sessions
- All knowledge files are auto-generated by AI based on code analysis
- Session files track user progress and prevent collaboration conflicts
- ALWAYS follow the mandatory execution rules for consistency
- ALWAYS check and follow requirements.md before any task
- When in doubt, document more rather than less
- Keep knowledge files concise but comprehensive
